**Train Scheduler Attempt (Easier Homework)**
Lo and behold, today is your lucky day. You get another Predator themed homework attempt. The gods are smiling upon you today.

# Object
The user (you) would enter the train's name, destination, desired time of the maiden voyage, and frequency (how often train would come by
again). When the SUBMIT button is clicked, it would enter the schedule in the field above it called "Current Train Schedule." If you noticed, the Current Train Schedule would then calculate when the next arrival time of each train would be; this is in military time per homework's instructions and picture example. Finally, the last column would calculate the # of minutes away each train is before it arrives.* 

# Tech
In this project, Firebase is used to store data until it is retrieved for webpage visibility. Some typical Javascript magic is also
in the works, along with using moment.js to parse and return dynamic timestamping. In this case, it helps to calculate when 
the next train is coming based on the 1st train's time the user would input. 

# Parting Words
CSS can still use a last polishing, since I can't seem to make the tables go smaller once I go to mobile typical specs. It took a while to get the Y axis scroll bar to work though! However the X axis won't dynamically scroll unless I make the width of the table smaller even at large device display, which I am still looking for a solution. 

*The interesting part is the code overall worked swimmingly and wow I can't believe it. I am treating myself to a very lavish dessert.
